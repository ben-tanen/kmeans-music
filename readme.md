## k-means music

This is an attempt to use [Spotify's audio feature data](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/) and [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to algorithmically generate playlists of similar songs.

Full write up on this experiment can be found in the contained Jupyter notebook as well as [on my website](http://ben-tanen.com/notebooks/kmeans-music.html).

If you're looking to use this code for your own library, see `kmeans-music.py` for a simplified script (sans any commentary, validation, or analysis).
