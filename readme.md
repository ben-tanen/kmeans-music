## k-means music

This is an attempt to use [Spotify's audio feature data](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/) and [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to algorithmically generate playlists of similar songs.

Currently working on the project in this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ben-tanen/kmeans-music/blob/master/2018.12.06%20-%20kmeans%20playlist%20clustering.ipynb), but will ultimately post it to my website (link to come).
