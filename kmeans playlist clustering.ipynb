    "This is an attempt to use [Spotify's audio feature data](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/) and [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to algorithmically generate playlists of similar songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently working on the project in this jupyter notebook, but will ultimately post it to my website (link to come).\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "[Back in 2016](https://www.recode.net/2016/9/27/13070726/spotify-daily-mix-playlist), Spotify rolled out their Daily Mixes feature, which automatically generates playlists of songs that you've already saved to your library. Spotify had previously released a number of auto-generated playlists (Discover Weekly, Release Radar), but as the names imply, these playlists were intentionally filled with tracks that you had not already saved. The Daily Mixes were different, instead focusing on creating playlists made up of songs saved in your library. Each mix is intended to hit on a different [\"listening mode or grouping\"](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2018-05-18/how-your-daily-mix-just-gets-you/) specific to each person, which means you might have a lo-fi hip hop mix and a stomp-and-holler folk mix both show up.\n",
    "\n",
    "I appreciated the concept behind the Daily Mixes, but I often found that the \"listening mode\" I was into at the moment was not always represented in the Daily Mixes. This made me wonder how difficult it would be to create my own generated mixes so that I could find a playlist of my own music that truly matched the vibe of a song or album I was into. This gave birth to the concept of using clustering to quickly generate a bunch of (hopefully) representative mixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have previously written about/used both [k-means clustering](http://ben-tanen.com/blog/2016/03/09/clustering-with-kmeans.html) and [Spotify's API data](http://ben-tanen.com/blog/2016/08/26/spotify-popularity.html) before, so these two were a natural combination to try for this experiement. Spotify obviously has substantially more data available for their analyses and they have teams of much more qualified data scientists working on their algorithms, but maybe, just maybe, I would be able to crack into one of their secrets...\n",

    "I'm going to use [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for interfacing with Spotify and then [scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for my clustering analysis."

The songs that are being grouped together appear to share a relatively similar `duration_ms`, which makes sense because there is a lot more variance from that variable compared to the other metrics that range from 0 - 1. The k-means algorithm is going to be driven towards those more varied variables, even if that is not our intention. This is why you are *suppose* to normalize your data first!\n",

One of the difficulties of any clustering analysis is validating your results and knowing if the clusters that are output even make sense.
